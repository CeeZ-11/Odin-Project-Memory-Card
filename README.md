# 🃏 Memory Card Game

A fun and interactive memory game built with React using hooks and API data fetching.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is part of a React Course designed to reinforce concepts like:

- **State Management** using Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)

5. Track your **Current Score** and **Best Score**.
